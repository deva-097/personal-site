### ~~1. Homepage: Add grounding sentence to intro~~ DONE
### ~~2. Homepage: Edit "Welcome to my site" post~~ DONE (deleted post, folded into intro)

### 3. Commonplace page: Add one-line teasers to each entry
Currently just titles with no preview — no reason to click. Add a pull-quote or one sentence on why you saved it. The selection is interesting (Bojack Horseman next to Rudyard Kipling) — let that personality show on the listing page.

### 4. Interests page: Add micro-commentary to Fountain Pens and Wallets
The section intros are already great ("Recovering fountain pen addict", "$2Mn wishlist") and item-level notes like "Lost at BLR airport security" make it human. Fountain Pens and Wallets sections are comparatively dry — which pen do you reach for most? Which wallet surprised you? One line per item is enough.
