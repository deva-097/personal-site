This is the beginning of something new.

I've wanted to create a personal corner on the internet for a while now — a place to collect my thoughts, document what I'm learning, and share the things that interest me.

This site is that place. It will evolve over time. For now, it's simple and sparse, but that's intentional. I want to focus on the content first and let the form follow.

## What you'll find here

**Writing** — Essays and notes on topics I'm thinking about. These might be half-formed thoughts or more polished pieces. The goal is to write more, not to write perfectly.

**Reading** — Books I've read, with brief notes when I have something to say about them.

**Interests** — Collections of things I care about: fountain pens, watches, music, and whatever else catches my attention.

**Experiments** — Small tools I've built for myself on my AI learning journey.

## Why now?

There's something about having your own space on the internet that feels different from posting on social media. Here, I control the format, the pace, and the permanence. There's no algorithm deciding what gets seen. No pressure to perform.

It's just me, putting things out there for anyone who might find them useful or interesting.

If you're reading this, welcome. I hope you find something worthwhile.
