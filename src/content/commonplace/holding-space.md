The concept that bartenders and therapists listen very well, do not offer solutions or judgement. Help you sit there with your problems (hold space) and then eventually work things out.

—

**Who holds space for you?**

And more importantly: **For whom are you holding space?**

Because we all need witnesses. We all need someone to sit with our mess and not run. We all need that bartender, that therapist, that friend who... gets it.

And we all have the capacity to be that person for someone else.

It doesn't require training. It doesn't require a license or a degree. It just requires presence. It requires the willingness to say, "I see you. I hear you. Your mess is welcome here."
