*Do not ask your children<br>
to strive for extraordinary lives.<br>
Such striving may be admirable,<br>
but it is the way of foolishness.<br>
Help them instead to find the wonder<br>
and the marvel of an ordinary life.<br>
Show them the joy of tasting<br>
tomatoes, apples, and pears.<br>
Show them how to cry<br>
when pets and people die.<br>
Show them the infinite pleasure<br>
in the touch of a hand.<br>
And make the ordinary come alive for them.<br>
The extraordinary will take care of itself.*
