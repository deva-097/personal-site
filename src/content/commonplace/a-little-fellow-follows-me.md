A careful man I want to be —<br>
a little fellow follows me.<br>
I do not dare to go astray,<br>
for fear he'll go the self-same way.<br>
I cannot once escape his eyes.<br>
Whatever he sees me do he tries.<br>
Like me he says he's going to be —<br>
that little chap who follows me…

He knows that I am big and fine —<br>
And believes in every word of mine.<br>
The base in me he must not see —<br>
that little chap who follows me…

But after all it's easier,<br>
that brighter road to climb,<br>
With little hands behind me —<br>
to push me all the time.<br>
And I reckon I'm a better man<br>
than what I used to be…<br>
Because I have this lad at home<br>
who thinks the world of me.
