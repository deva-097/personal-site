description: "A poem about living with elegance and contentment"

*To live content with small means.<br>
To seek elegance rather than luxury,<br>
and refinement rather than fashion.<br>
To be worthy not respectable,<br>
and wealthy not rich.<br>
To study hard, think quietly, talk gently,<br>
act frankly, to listen to stars, birds, babes,<br>
and sages with open heart, to bear all cheerfully,<br>
do all bravely, await occasions, hurry never.<br>
In a word, to let the spiritual,<br>
unbidden and unconscious,<br>
grow up through the common.<br>
This is to be my symphony.*
